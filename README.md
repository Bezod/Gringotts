Gringotts
=========

Gringotts is an item-based economy plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft server platform. Unlike earlier economy plugins such as iConomy, all currency value and money transactions are based on actual items in Minecraft, per default emeralds. The goals are to add a greater level of immersion, a generally more Minecraft-like feeling, and in the case of a PvP environment, making the currency itself vulnerable to raiding.

Gringotts was created for the [Minecraft Wars](http://www.minecraft-wars.com/) PvP/survival server.

Usage
-----
Storing money in an account requires a Gringotts vault. A vault consists of a container, which can be either chest, dispenser or furnace, and a sign above declaring it as a vault. A player or faction may claim any number of vaults. Vaults are not protected from access through other players. If you would like them to be, you may use additional plugins such as [LWC](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/lwc/) or [WorldGuard](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard/).

### Player vaults ###
Place a sign above a container block, with `[vault]` written on the first line. If it was created correctly, the will display your name on the third line and you will receive a message that the vault has been created.

### Faction vaults ###
Place a sign above a container block, with `[faction vault]` written on the first line. If it was created correctly, the will display your faction's tag on the third line and you will receive a message that the vault has been created.

## Towny vaults ###

* To make a vault for your town: place a sign above a container block, with `[town vault]` written on the first line. 
* To make a vault for your nation: place a sign above a container block, with `[nation vault]` written on the first line. 
If it was created correctly, the will display your faction's tag on the third line and you will receive a message that the vault has been created.

    /gringotts reload

Installation
------------
* download [Gringotts v1.3.0](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/642/288/Gringotts-1.3.0.jar) and place it in your craftbukkit/plugins folder
* download [Apache Derby](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/derby/derby/10.9.1.0/derby-10.9.1.0.jar) and place it in your craftbukkit/lib folder



Configuration
-------------
As usual with Bukkit plugins, the configuration is in the config.yml in the plugin's directory. A config.yml with the default settings is is created after starting and stopping the server with the plugin for the first time.

### Currency ###
Per default Gringotts uses emeralds as currency, but this can be changed to any other type of item.

Example configuration section:

    currency:
      type: 388
      datavalue: 0
      name:
        singular: Emerald
        plural: Emeralds
      fractional: true

This is the default configuration which uses emeralds as currency.

#### Individual settings

* `type` The [item id](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values#Item_IDs) of the actual item type to use as currency.
* `datavalue` Some items, such as dyes, have different subtypes. To specify the exact item type, set this field appropriately. For example, to use Lapis Lazuli, set `type` to `351` and `datavalue` to `4`.
* `name` Name of the currency to be used in messages to players. Please enter both a singular and plural version.
* `fractional` Whether to allow fractional values. `true` or `false`

### Taxes ###

Gringotts supports two types of taxes on transactions done via `/money pay` command: `flat` and `rate`. Flat taxes are a flat amount added to any transaction, while rate adds a percentage of the actual transaction. These can be used individually or combined.

Example configuration section:

    transactiontax:
      flat: 1.0
      rate: 0.05

This would add to every transaction 1 plus 5% of the transaction value. For instance, if you had issued the command `/money pay 200 notch` it would remove 211 emeralds from your account, and add 200 emeralds to notch's account.

### Misc ###

    usevault:
      container: true

Enable the use of container vaults: chests, dispensers and furnaces. If this is `false`, only player's inventory and/or enderchests will serve as a player "vault".
